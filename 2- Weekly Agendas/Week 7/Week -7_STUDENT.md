Understanding statistics is essential to understand research in the social and behavioral sciences. In this week you will learn the basics of statistics. 

<br>

**1. How many goals have the top strikers of the Dutch Eredivisie football competition scored? We look at 10 strikers and obtained the following information: 12, 10, 11, 12, 11, 14, 15, 18, 21, 11. The (1) ... of the dataset equals 12, the mean equals (2) ... and the (3) ... equals 11. The standard deviation equals (4) ... Fill in the right words/numbers on the dots.**

<strong>A.</strong> (1) Median, (2) 11, (3) Mode, (4) 3.57<br>
<strong>B.</strong> 
(1) Median, (2) 13.5, (3) Mode, (4) 3.57<br>
<strong>C.</strong> (1) Mode, (2) 13.5, (3) Median, (4) 12.72<br>
<strong>D.</strong> (1) Mode, (2) 11, (3) Median, (4) 12.72


<br>

**2. What is the difference between variables and constants?**

<strong>A.</strong> 
Constants are discrete variables, variables are continuous variables.<br>

Constants vary across cases, variables do not vary.<br>
<strong>D.</strong> 
Variables are discrete variables, constants are continuous variables.


<br>

<strong>3.</strong>  The country of birth of presidents of the United States.
<br>
<strong>4.</strong> The value of a number divided by itself.
<br>
<strong>5.</strong> The total number of runs scored in baseball games.
<br>
<strong>6.</strong> The number of days in each of the twelve months in a year.




<br>

**4. Define each of the following, in your own words.**

<strong>A.</strong> Population<br>
<strong>B.</strong> Sample<br>
<strong>C.</strong>	Null hypothesis
<br>
<strong>D.</strong> Alternate hypothesis



<br>

**5. What is the main difference between an experimental design and a correlational design?**



<br>

**6. What is the main difference between an experimental design and a correlational design?**
